##  Key Features in Action

### Smart Budget Validation
When you save expenses:
1. System calculates total expenses
2. Compares to monthly earnings
3. If over budget:
   - AI analyzes the situation
   - Suggests which expenses to reduce
   - Provides specific alternatives
   - Shows exact overage amount

### AI Conversations
The AI assistant can:
- Answer specific questions about your finances
- Provide budgeting strategies
- Suggest ways to save money
- Help prioritize expenses
- Validate if purchases fit your budget
- Give encouragement and practical advice

Example interactions:
```
You: "Can I afford to spend $200 on a new phone?"
AI: "Based on your current budget, you have $450 
remaining this month. A $200 phone would leave 
you with $250. However, I notice your monthly 
goals total $300. I'd suggest either postponing 
some goals or finding a phone under $150 to stay 
on track."
```
